the Parliament without having obtained the permission
‘of the King and all his peers, and this in full Parlia-

ment‚ and of this permission record shall be made in
the roll of the Parliament3 and if any one of the peers
during the Parliamfflt be sick, so that he cannot come
'to the Parliament‚ then for three days he shall send
excusers to the Pal-liment, on which day, if he do not
come, two of his peers shall be sent to see and testify
of his sickness, and if there be any suspicion those
two peers shall be sworn that they will speak the
truth3 and if it be found that he has feigned he shall
be amerced as for default, *and if he has not feigned
then he shall attorn some sufficient person before
