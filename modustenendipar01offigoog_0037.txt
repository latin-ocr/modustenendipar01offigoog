diem, and those tenned valenti, though returned for a
county, only had 2⁸. each.

In 1323 the knights received 30. 4d. each, and the vala-ti
only 15. ed.

In 1324 the knights had 2⁸. 6d. each per diem ς and

In 1325 they had 3⁸.

From the year 1327 the allowance to the county mem·
bers, whether knights or valeati, was 4⁸. per diem each,
exclusive of the charge of going to and returning from
Parliament 3 and this sum appears to have been paid as long
as ι the members received payment for their attendance at
Parliament.

(19) ΤΙι6 only two titles of temporal peers mentioned in
the Modus are those of earls and barons, a fact which goes
far to prove that it was written before any others were
created3 the dignity of Duke was first conferred in the
eleventh of Edward the Third, and that of Mal-quis in the
ninth of Richard the Second. Moreover, it was enacted in
the fifth of Richard the Second, that “ whatsoever person
“in the kingdom who should thenceforth have summons to
‘⁴ Parliament, be he archbishop, bishop, abbat, prior, duke‚
‘⁸ carl, baron, banneret, knight of county, citizen of city,
“ and burgess of borough‚ and should be absent, or should
‘⁴ not come on such sumamus, should be amerced or other-
“ wisc punished.” Therefore, had the title of Duke been
in existence when the Modus was written, the author of it,
who is particularly minute in his description of the degrees
and places in Parliament (p. 25.& 33.) would hardly have passed
them over without some notice. Prynne, however, in his
Animadversions on the Fourth hstitute, states, that the
calling over the names of the estates of Parliament was
practised pursuant to the statute of 5 Richard 11. 3 and in
his ‘⁴ Pleu for the Lords,” p. 29„ he says that the Modus
was manufactured out of that statute. In answer to which
i‘t may be again stated that the title of Duke is mentioned in
that statute, which, had it· been known to the author of the
Modus, he certainly would not have omitted to mention it.
