(⁷) “ Upon consideration of all the premises‚ and of the
⁴‘ levelling passages of holding a Parliament by the King
“ and the Commons alone, without the LordS, if the Lords
“ were summoned and refused to come, as most of them did
“ in this very Parliament upon its prorogation‚ for which,
‘⁶ on the last day of February 32 Hen. 6., they were deeply
“ fined (at the petition of the Commons, without impoeing
“ any fine upon any Commoner then absent), and some of
‘⁴ those fines agreeing with the very sums in this Μοᾶιιε,
‘⁴ though somewhat mistaken in the rest, there being no
“ other president of any such fines but this. I strongly
“ apprehend that this Modus tenendi Parliamentum was
“ compiled between the twenty-seventh and thirty-third
“ years of King Henry the Sixth his reign by some creature
“ of Richard Duke of York, who in the Pan-liament of
‘⁰ 31 8ο 32 Η. 6. (when I conceive this Modus was forged),
“ by the Commons petition, and his confederacy with them,
“ was made chief councillor, protector, and defendet· of the
“ realm, &cf (Prynne’s Fourth Part of the Brief Register‚

p. 607.)

(8) “ This Modus, treating ‘ Dc locis et sessionibus in
“ Parliamento‚’ informs us that on the right hand of the
‘⁶ King's throne ‘ sedebit archiepiscopus Cautum-iensis ct
“ episcopi London ct Winton‚ ct post illos scriatim alii
“ episcopi, abbatae, &Q et in parte sinistra Reqis sedebunt
“ archiepiscopus Ebor’ episcopus Dunclm’ et Carliol', etpost
“ illos seriatim comites? ὅσα, which seems to be horrowed,
“ with some grosse mistakeS, out of the statute of 31 Hen. 8.
“ c. 10., and so compiled after it-.” (The Fourth Part of a
Brief Register, διο. of Parliamentary write, p. 562.)

(9) Resides his attack of the Modus in his “Brief Animad-
“ versione on and Amendments of the Fourth Part of Coke’e
‘⁶ Institutesss’ Prynne wrote an elaborate chapter (section
V111.)in the fourth part of a brief register of Parliamentary
Writs, which purports to contain “ a clear discovery and
‘⁴ refutation of manifold falsitieS, forgerieffi errore in the
“ pretended antient treatise and record (but in truth late
“ imposture) intituled ‘ Modus tenendi Parliamentum,’ and
“ Sir Edmrd Coke's asseverations ‚of its great antiquity
