of them, shall elect twenty-five persons out of all the
peers of the realm, that is, two bishops and three
procuratore for the whole clergy; two earls and three
barons, five knights of shims, five citizens, and [five ¹]
burgesses, which make twenty-five3 and these twenty-
five may select twelve from among themselves, and
reduce themselves to that number, and these twelve
may reduce themselves ιο siz, and those six may still
further reduce themselves to three, but those three
cannot reduce themselves to a less number unless
licence be obtained from our lord the King3 and should
the King give his consent, then those three may reduce
themselves to two, and one of those two may delegate
his power to the other, and thus, finally, his ordinance
will stand superior in authority to the whole Parlia-
ment3 and so by reduction from twenty-five persons ιο
one individual person, unless the greater number be
able ιο come to agreement and give judgment3 in fine,
one single individual, as it is said, who cannot disagree
with himself, shall ordain for all; reserving to our lord
the King and his eouncil the power of examining and
amending such ordinances after they have been written,
if they know how and wish so to do, so that it be there
then done in full Parliament, and with the consent of
Parliament, and not otherwise.

² The context requires that there shall be five citizens and five burgesses
to make up the number of twenty-five. The whole paragraph however
is very obscure, but the sense seems that the members have power to reduce
their numbers and delegate their power ιο such reduction. ⁴⁶ Conde-
“ scendere” implies yielding ιο the decision of the diminished party, and
this appears from a single person at last„ having the power of the whole
twenty-five.
