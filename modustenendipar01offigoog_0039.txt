(28) This work principally consists of a collection of
ancient documenta chiefly relating to ecclesiastical affaire,
such as acts, canone, couneus, chronielesg lives of sainte
letters patent, chau-tem, 8⁶0„ taken ,from Freneh monastic
librarieS. It was originally published in thirteen volumes
qum-to, 1653-1677. A· new edition, in three volumes folio,
by Francis Joseph· de la Barre was issued in 1725.

D'Achery does not state where the manuscript is to be
found from which. he printed the ‘⁶ Modus tenendi Parlia»
‘⁶ mentum ;’' but there is a copy of it in the Bibliotheque
du Rei at Paris, among the Gruthuyse Mauuseript& which
has been collated with D'Achery’s text, and they agree
litteratim. Monsieur Claude, who kindly undertook the
trouble of this comparison for me, writes “ quoiqu’il en soit
“ ee ns. est celui de la· Gruthuyse, et la collation que ,i'en
“ ai faite avec l'imprime‚ m'a prouve jusqu’a la derniere
‘⁶ evidence que e’est celui qui a servi ἃ D. D’Achery pour
‘⁶ faire. son edition. 11 n’y a pas entre ee us. et l'edition la
“ plus petite varinnasoit dans le texte, soit dans les titres.
‘⁶‘ Locatalogue le donne comme etant du XIV. siecle, et il n’y
“ a pas l‘ombre d’un doute a elever a eet egani? M. Claude
also states that the copy of the Modus which was made for
the late &cord commission, through the intervention of
Mt. G. Ρ. Οοορθτ, πω taken from the Gruthuyse Manuscript,
No. 6049, and that there is no other copy of the Modus in
the Bibliotheqae du Roi.

· (29) The British Museum does not possess a copy of the
'edition of 1641. Editions appeared in 1659 and 1671, edited
by Mt. Hakewel of Lincoln’s Inn. Elsing’s Manner of
holding Parliaments in England is an originalwork, and not
a translation of the Latin Modus, though there are therein
frequent references to the Modus.

There are several manuscript copies. of the English trans-
lation extant in the Britiah Mamm and Collega of Arma,
