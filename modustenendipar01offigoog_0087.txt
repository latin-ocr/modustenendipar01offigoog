The. separation of the Parliament used to be in
this manner t—it ought first to be asked and publiely
proelaimed in the Parliament‚ and within the palaee of
the Parliament, if there be any one who shall have
delivered a petition to the Parliament to whieh no
answer has yet been given, and if no one shall answer
it is to be supposed that remedy has been afforded to
every one, or at least been answered as far as ean be
rightly done, and then, first, to wit, when no one who
at that time has exhibited his petition shall answer,-

“ we will release our Parliament.’'
