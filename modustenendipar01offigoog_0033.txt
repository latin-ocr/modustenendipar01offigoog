“- against the authority of the English Modus ; and so con*-
“ vinced of their force was an able advocate for the exist-
“ ence of the commons as a constituent part of Parliament
“ before the 49 Henry 3, that he candidly gives up its
‘⁴ antiquity, though if it could have been defended, it would
“ have decided the controversy in his favour, for it expressly

“ mentions citizens and burgesses as well as knights of the
“ shire. (See 4 Inst. p. 12. Seld. Tit. Hon. 2d ed. Part 2.

“ 270. 406.) However Dr. Dopping, bishop of Meath‚ who
“ in 1692 first published the Irish Modus, feebly endeavours
“ to defend the antiquity of the supposed transcript in the
“ time of Henry 2, and two other writers deservecny of
“ great eredit seem inclined the same way. See Melyn,
‘⁴ case of Ireland, and Harr- Edit. of Ware’s Hist. and
‘⁶ Antiq. of Irel. 84. Mr. Selden mentions, that in his time
“ there were many copies of the English ModuS, but I am
“ not aware that any one is in print.” (Hargrave’s Note to

Litt. 2. 69 1).)
(11) Such for instance as the passages at pp. 11. 37.

(12) The Editor has neither seen nor heard of any mnu-
script of the English Modus that does not contain the
Proeme, but the Irish Modus which was exemplified in the
Sixth of Henry the Fourth is without it, and so also is the
copy os the Irish Modus in the German uss„ and in that
copy King Henry the Fourth’s exemplification does not
even occur; it begins thus: “ Modus tenendi Parliamenta
“ et concilia in Hibernia.”

(13) sse ‘⁴ Modus tenendi Parliamentum,” in Hibernia,
was first published, in 1692, by Anthony Dopping, lord
bishcp of Meath, and a new edition of it was printed in
-17 12. The bishop believes it to be the same referred to by
Sir Edward Coke,' and considers it, notwithstanding Prynne’s
objections, to be an authentic document.

The copy of the Irish Modus referred to by Coke, Selden,
Prynne‚ and Dopping, professes to be of the time of King
Henry the Fourth, Itis an exemplification under the Great
Seal of Ireland in the sixth year of the reign of King
Hem-y the Fourth, when sir John Talbot of Hallamshire
was the lord lieutenant.
