all the peers of the Realm3 and the Parliament ought

to be held in a publio and not in a private or obscure
pla0e3 on festival days the Parliament ought to begin

at prime hour on aeoount of divine service.

Concnnmne Tm: Dssennns on Tm: anzs.

The King is the head, beginning, and end of Parlia-
ment, and so he has no peer in his degree, and so the
first degree oonsists of the King alone ; the seeond degree

is os the arehbishOPS‚ bishops, abbots, priors holding by ’

barony3 the third degree is of the procuratore of the
olergy3 the fourth of the earls, barons, and other
magnates and nobles, holding to the value of a oounty
or barony‚ as is aforesaid under the head of the laity;
the fifth is of the knights of shires3 the sixth of the
citizens and burgesseS. And so Parliament is oomposed
of six degrees. But it must be known that although
any of the said degi-ees, below the King‚ be absent, if
they have been summoned by reasonable summonses of
l Parliament, the Parliament shall nevertheless be oon-

sidered complete.
