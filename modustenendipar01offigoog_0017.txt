“. libet eor-um quatuor solidos,'’ a circumstance
which proves that those words were interpolated
aster the wages of each of the county members
attending Parliament- had been fixed at 43. per
diem. Now we know, from a source that
admits of no dispute,—-· the records of the ex-
penses of knights of the shire and burgesses
for serving in Parliament,— that the wages of
county members were not settled before the
first of Edward the Third 1327 (18), conse-
quently it must be inferred, whatever may be
the date of the interpolation, that the text itself
of the Modus was written before that year-3
and this inference receives support stom the
absence throughout the treatise of all mention
of any higher grade of nobility than an earl,
the first creation of a duke having been made
by Edward the Third in the eleventh year of
his reign. (19) ·

Another incidental fact may be mentioned
as showing the age when the author of the
Modus may be presumed to have lived. In the
clause “ DE BAnomnus Pon‘rnuu” (p. 7.) it is
stated that the ,barons of the Cinq Ports received
lOs. per diem for their parliamentary attendance.
This statement is one of Prynne’s chief objec-
tions against its authenticity on the ground
