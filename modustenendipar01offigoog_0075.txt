PARLIAMENT.

The King is bound by all means to be personally
present in Parliament, unless hindered by corporal
infirmity, and then he can keep his chamber, so that
he does not lie out of the manor or at least the
town where Parliament is holden, and then he ought
to send for twelve of the greater and better persons
who are summoned to Parliament, to wit, two bishops,
two earls, two barons, two knights of shires, two
citizens, and two burgesses to visit his person and
testify of his state, and in their presence he ought to
commission the archbishop of the province, the steward‚
and chief justice jointly and severally to begin and
continue the Parliament in his name, express mention
being made in that commission of the cause of his
then absence, which should satisfy and advise the rest
of the nobles and magnates of Parliament, together
with the evident testimony of their said twelve peers.

The reason is, that clamour and murmurs used to be

in Parliament on account of the King’s absence, ’

because it is a hurtful and dangerous thing for the
whole commonalty of Parliament‚ and also for the
realm, when the King is absent from the Parliament‚

nor ought he nor can 'he absent himself unless only
in the abovesaid case.
