“ Preston‚ at Calne, in Ireland, under King Hem-y the
“ Fourth, not much differing from this usual ‘ Modus
“ tenendi Parliamenmm’ in England‚ only that it is made
“ proper for Ireland, and supposed to have been sent thither
“ by King Hem-y the Second, when he conquered Ireland‚
‘⁶ for a direction how to hold their Parliament. But the
“ sense of it is for the most part just like that whereof we
“ have so many eopies for England. It ww, as Ι have
“ heard, exemplified by Ira-speximus under the Great Seal
“ of Ireland by the lord Talbot, lieutenant of behind, under
“ Hem-y the Fourth‚ and I had from my worthy friend
‘⁶ Mr. Haekwell of Lincoln’s Inn the use of a copy of the
“ exemplification that was transcribed out of it, when here-
“ tofore the exemplification itself, under seul, was in his

112ῃὲιῇ whoever was the author of this Irish Modus, I

“ think, doubtless took it out of this other whereof we have
“ so many copies in England, and so fitted it to that king·
“ dom, not only in the supposed parliamentary forms, but
“ also in the title, that it might have every way like relation
“ to Ireland as the other to England. For as that of
“ England is supposed to have been declared before King
“ william, and allowed by him at his conquest, so this also
“ by Hem-y the Second at his of Ireland. But I do not
“ believe that either of them were so ancient as Henry the
‘⁶ Second. His style in it agrees not with any that I have
“ seen of him. Nor before King- J ohn's time were sheriffs
“ and other officers and dignitaries (according to the English
“ pattern) so settled there that those dignities and offiees to
“ whom (even as at this day the use is) the Inspeximus is
“ directed could have had such place in it under Hem-y the

¹“ Second.”

(14) Although it is apparent that Prynne had only seen
comparatively modern copies of the Modus, yet it is certain

that he was aware that copies as early as the reigns of
Edward the Third and Richard the Second had been seen

by Selden and Agard, for in his Animadversions on the
Fourth Inst.‚ p. 7 ., he writers “ And no sooner had he
“ (Coke) extolled its antiquity and authority in print, but our
“ most judicious‚ industrious antiquat-y Mr. John Selden
