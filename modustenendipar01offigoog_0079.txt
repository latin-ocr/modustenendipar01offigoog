The crier of Parliament shall stand without the door

of the Parliament, and the doorkeeper shall announce

his serjeants at arms to stand amid the great space

without the door of Parliament to keep the door, so
that none should make assaults or tumults about the
doors by which the Parliament might be disturbed under
pain of caption of their bodies, because by right the
door of Parliament ought not to be shut, but guarded

by the doorkeepers and king's serJeants at arms· Α
