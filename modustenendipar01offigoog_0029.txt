NOTES.

 

(1) “ Sir Edward Coke vouched it in the Parliament of
· “ 35 Eliz. an. 1592„ when he was speaker, which Modus a
“ grave member of the house then-showed and delivered to
“ him (as he informed the house in his argument of Fitz-
“ herbert’s case), which book if any member desired to see,
“ he then said, he would shew it him; being a president
“ of a Parliament holden before the Conquest, intituled
“ Modus tenendi Parliamentum.” (Prynne's Animadver-
sions on the 4th Institute, p. 7.)

“ Parliamentum.

 

⁴‘ Now for antiquity and authority of the ancient treatise
“ called Modus tenendi Parliamentum, &c., whereof we
⁴⁴ make osten use in this part of the InstituteS, certain it is
*ί that this Modus was rehem-sed and declared before the
‘⁸ Conquerour at the time of his conquest, and by him
“ approved for England, and accordingly the Conquerour,
“ according to Modum, held a Parliament for Engmd, as
‘⁴ it appeareth in 21 Ε. 3. fo. 60. After King H. 2. had
‘⁸ conquered Ireland‚ he fitted and transcribed this Modus
“ into Ireland in a parchment roll, for the holding of Par-
“ liaments there, which no doubt H. 2. did by advise of
“ his judges, being a matter of so great weight and legall.
