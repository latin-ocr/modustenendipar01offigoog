‘⁴ 'This Modus, 'in the parchment roll transcribed as afore-
“ said by H. 2., remained in Ireland, and in anno 6 H. 4.
“ was in the custody of Sir Christofer Preston knight, a
’μ’ “ man of great wisedome and learning, which roll King H. 4.
ᾗ “ in the same yeare, De assensu J ohannis Talbot chivaliei‘,
¹ “ his lieutenant there, and of his cowncell of Ireland, exem·
1 ‘⁴ plified for the better holding of the Parliaments there}
“ and in the exemplification it expresly appeareth that
‘⁶ H. 2. did transcribe this ModuS, as is abovesaid.

‘⁴ This Modus was seene by the makers of the statute of

 

“ Magna Charta, anno 9 Η. 3. cap. 2., concerning the
‘⁴ reducing of the ancient reliefes ' of entire earldomes,
“ baronies, and knights feeS, according to such proportions
‘⁴‘ as is contained in the Modus, which they could not have
“ done so punctually if they had not seene the same,
“ whereof you may read more at large in the first part of
“ the InstituteS, sect. 103. fo. 76. verbo Relief. And some
“ part of this Modus is cited in the Parliament Roll, anno
“ l l R. 2. and other records of Parliament, and upon dili·
“ gent search we can find nothing against it. But many
“ very ancient copies you may find of this ModuS, one
“ whereof we have scene in the reigne of H. 2., which con-
“ taineth the manner, forme, and usage of Gilbert de
“ Scrogel, marshal] of England, in what manner he occupied
“ and used the said roome and office in all his time, and how
“ he was admitted, διο. at 'the coronation of H. 2., and of
‘⁶ his knight marshall and other inseriour officere, &c., and
“ adj oyned thereunto, and of the same hand in this ModuS,
“ as fit sor him to know.

  

“ But lest it might be said to me, as it was once said to
“ an oratour, who having spoken much in commendation of
“ Hercules, it was demanded of one that stood by, ‘ Quis
‘⁶ vituperavit ?' Ad quod non fuit responsum.” (Coke, 4Inst’.
