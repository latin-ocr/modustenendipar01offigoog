ii pannon.

Lord Chief J ustice Coke appears to have
hastily formed an opinion in ignorance of the
ancient constitution of Parliament, and without
giving proper attention to the facts stated · in
the treatise, and a corrupt text was manifestly
relied upon by Prynne. The reader‚ however,
has now an accurate text collated with the
oldest and best Mea.; and, as all the most
striking variations have been noted in this
edition, a juster estimate may be obtained as
well of the period when the writer of the
treatise lived, as of the degree of authority to
which, as an historian, he is entitled.

Attention was particularly directed to this
document as early as the reign of Queen
Elizabeth by Sir Edward Coke‚ when Speaker
of the House of Commons (1), afterwards in
the preface to his ninth book of Reports (2),
again in his first and second Institutes (3)
where he alludes to it as an authentic work;
and in his fourth Institute (4), when treating
of the history and jurisdiction of the high
court of Parliament, he states it to be his
deliberate opinion that ‘⁴ this Modus was re·
‘⁶ hearsed and declared before the Conqueror
‘⁴ at the time of his conquest, and by him
“ approved for England.
